<h3>Overview</h3>
Certification as a national SOFG Coach lasts three years and requires a deep understanding of the Effective School Boards framework, the ability to demonstrate that understanding in practice, and the ability to support governance teams through its implementation. These competencies are revealed through demonstrations of learning regarding:
<ul>
  <li>Governance Knowledge (GK 1-13)</li>
  <li>Governance Skill (GS 1-11) </li>
  <li>Governance Mindset (GM 1-4)</li>
  <li>Coaching Knowledge (CK 1-7)</li>
  <li>Coach ing Skill (CS 1-6)</li>
  <li>Coaching Mindset (CM 1-5)</li> 
</ul><br/> 

Coach certification is not a guarantee of being placed as a coach with a CGCS member district.        
<br/><br/>
        
For those seeking ESB certification as well, candidates will need to demonstrate knowledge of the similaries and differences between the two frameworks. 
<br/><br/>

For those seeking LSG certification as well, the most challenging difference in requirements is the EISO requirement: LSG certification requires completing the Evaluating & Improving Student Outcomes (EISO) course and passing the EISO quiz (80%+).
<br/><br/>

<h3>Demonstrations of Learning</h3>
Unless there is a demonstration of learning (DoL) defined in the competency, each competency type relies on a default DoL. The default DoL for knowledge competencies is a writing or video artifact. The default DoL for skills competencies is coach observation in-person or via video artifact. The default DoL for mindset competencies is coach observation in-person or via video artifact. When providing a written artifact, if summarizing a document like an article or dissertation the expectation is a one page summary. If summarizing a book, the expectation is 1-2 paragraphs per chapter. When providing a video artifact, if demonstrating knowledge the expectation is a 1-2 minute explainer per competency (without notes or script). If demonstrating skill or mindset, it takes however long it takes per competency. Alternative DoLs can be determined by a Senior Coach (as is the case with aspiring coach cohorts).
<br/><br/>

Unless there is a demonstration of learning (DoL) defined in the competency, each competency type relies on a default DoL. 
<ul>
<li>The default DoL for knowledge competencies is a quad reviewed writing or video artifact. </li>
<li>The default DoL for skills competencies is coach observation in-person or via a quad reviewed video artifact. </li>
<li>The default DoL for mindset competencies is coach observation in-person or a quad reviewed via video artifact. </li>
<li>When providing a written artifact, if summarizing a document (ie: article or dissertation), the expectation is a ½ -1 page summary. If summarizing a book, the expectation is 1-2 paragraphs per chapter.</li>
<li>When providing a video artifact, if demonstrating knowledge the expectation is a 1-2 minute explainer per competency. If demonstrating skill or mindset, it takes however long it takes per competency.</li>
<li>Alternative demonstrations of learning can be determined by a Senior Coach.</li>
</ul><br/>

Here are definitions related to each artifact type:
<ul>
<li>Voice: It is important that all artifacts are in your unique voice. The intention of certification is that you have mastered as many competencies as possible, not to get you to sound like or mimic other coaches. The authenticity of your unique voice will be required for you to be an effective coach.</li>
<li>Quad Video: For this artifact type, four quadmates will explain the required material. Multiple competencies can be discussed during a single video, but each individual quadmate should only be discussing one specific competency. It is the job of each quadmate to ensure that each video is accurate and complete before it is submitted. If any aspect of a competency being discussed is either inaccurate or incomplete, none of the quadmates get credit for that competency. If all aspects of the competencies being discussed are both accurate and complete, all quadmates get credit for those competencies. By design, this often means that the quad will need to re-record a video to ensure that every aspect is accurate and complete.</li>
<li>Quad Reviewed Summary or Quad Reviewed Video: For this artifact type, all four quadmates will submit individual artifacts, but each artifact will be reviewed by their three quadmates to ensure it meets expectation. Each quadmate will first create the artifact themselves, then only once all four quadmates have completed their artifact, they’ll share them with each other. It’s the responsibility of the quadmates to ensure that each artifact is accurate and complete before it is submitted. If any aspect of a competency being demonstrated by any of the quadmates is either inaccurate or incomplete, none of the quadmates get credit for that competency. If all aspects of the competencies being demonstrated are both accurate and complete for all four quadmates’ individual artifacts, all quadmates get credit for those competencies. By design, this often means that the quad will need to push for a re-creation of an artifact to ensure that every aspect is accurate and complete.</li>
</ul><br/>

For aspiring coaches who are in a cohort program, artifacts are submitted to faculty in the manner described in the cohort syllabus. For aspiring coaches who are not in a cohort, artifacts are submitted to coach@effectiveschoolboards.com in the manner arranged with the senior coach who is assigned to you.

<h3>Certification Life Cycle</h3>
<h5>Certification Competency Updates</h5>
Each year, the certification competencies are reviewed. Most years, no changes are made, but if changes are made, they typically are announced by November 1st and go into effect on January 1st. For aspiring coaches who are in the midst of earning certification, they are typically afforded a 6-month hold harmless period to earn certification under the former competencies -- after which they must earn under the revised competencies.
<br/><br/>

<h5>Certification Maintenance Requirements</h5>
Maintenance of SOFG Coach certification requires earning 10 points per year. If a coach does not earn at least 10 points per year, their certification will lapse and they will need to complete the full certification process again from the beginning. Where pre-approval or determination of effectiveness is required, a Senior SOFG Coach is able to provide.
<br/><br/>

Coaches earn points in any of the following ways:
<ul>
<li>Effectively lead a pre-approved SOFG 2-day workshop for at least 16 participants (10pts)</li>
<li>Effectively coach a board as demonstrated by at least one board you are lead coach for being at 80+ points on their quarterly eval (25pts)</li>
<li>Effectively lead a pre-approved 3hr continuing education unit (CEU) for at least 8 coaches (5pts)</li>
<li>Complete a pre-approved 3hr CEU/professional development session for coaches (3pts)</li>
<li>Develop pre-approved curriculum -- whether written or video -- for coaches to use (5pts)</li>
</ul><br/>


<h5>Certification Renewal Requirements</h5>
Renewal of SOFG Coach certification requires earning at least 50 points during the term of certification and at least 30 
days prior to the expiration of their existing certification. If this has not been completed, then certification lapses and 
the coach will need to complete the full certification process again from the beginning.
  <br/><br/>



<h5>Certification Revocation</h5>
Revocation of SOFG Coach certification may happen at any time and is a decision of the majority of currently certified Senior 
SOFG Coaches. Prior to revocation, a progressive approach to addressing unacceptable behavior is preferable. Initial certification may also 
be withheld if, at the time that certification ordinarily would have been conveyed, the individual is determined by a majority of the 
Senior SOFG Coaches to be out of compliance with any of the following revocation criteria. Revocation may be warranted for circumstances 
that include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
  <li>Deficiencies identified in evaluations or other communications by a Senior SOFG Coach.</li>
  <li>Neglect of duties or responsibilities, or the conduct of other business that is deemed incompatible with SOFG certification.</li>
  <li>Incompetence or inefficiency in the performance of expected duties;</li>
  <li>Failure to comply with laws or with SOFG's policies.</li>
  <li>Drunkenness or excessive use of alcoholic beverages; illegal use of drugs, hallucinogens, or other controlled substances; 
 the possession, use, or being under the influence of alcohol, alcoholic beverages, drugs or controlled substances -- any of the aforementioned behaviors -- while 
on school property, acting within the scope of a certified coach's duties, or attending any school or school system-sponsored activity.</li>
  <li>Conviction of a felony or any crime involving moral turpitude.</li>
  <li>Failure to meet the SOFG's standards of professional conduct.</li>
  <li>Immorality, which is conduct the majority of Senior SOFG Coaches determine is not in conformity with the accepted moral 
standards of the community of SOFG Coaches.</li>

</ul>
