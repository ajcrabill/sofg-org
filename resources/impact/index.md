<h3>Introduction</h3>

Student Outcomes Focused Governance (SOFG) is a training and coaching framework intended to refocus school boards on student achievement. This analysis examines whether districts that fully implemented SOFG practices – defined here as having completed SOFG training and scoring ≥50/100 on the SOFG implementation instrument – saw better student outcomes over time than those that did not. We compare three groups of school systems: (1) those with no SOFG involvement (no training), (2) those that received SOFG training but did not implement effectively, and (3) those that were trained and implemented SOFG successfully. Key student outcome metrics include changes in Reading and Math performance (as measured by an Education Resource Strategies (ERS) analysis of grade-equivalent gains) and NAEP (National Assessment of Educational Progress) results for 4th and 8th grade Reading and Math. We also consider the timeline of SOFG implementation and control for district characteristics (size, poverty) to isolate any SOFG effect.
<br/><br/><br/>


<h3>Data Overview</h3>
			
The dataset covers 74 large urban districts (including all NAEP TUDA districts and others) from 2017–2024. For each district, we have indicators of SOFG participation (whether the school board completed the 2-day workshop, whether a SOFG coach was hired, and whether the board achieved a score ≥50 on the SOFG rubric, and in which year). District demographics include 2019 enrollment and % of students eligible for free/reduced lunch (poverty indicator). Student outcomes are captured in two ways:
<br/><br/>

<ul>
<li>ERS “Grade Equivalent” Gains: Change in performance (in grade-level equivalents) from 2019 to 2022, 2022 to 2024, and overall 2019 to 2024 in Reading and Math. These measures estimate how many grade-levels of learning students gained or lost over the time periods. For example, a value of -0.50 would indicate students are performing about half a grade level lower in 2024 than their predecessors did in 2019, on that subject’s assessments.</li>


<li>NAEP Scores and Proficiency: For the 27 Trial Urban District Assessment (TUDA) districts, NAEP 4th and 8th grade Reading and Math scores are given for 2019, 2022, and 2024, along with the change from 2019 to 2024 and from 2022 to 2024, and whether those changes are statistically significant. (NAEP uses a 0–500 scale; a change of ~10+ points often indicates a noticeable effect 1 .) Percentages of students proficient in 2019, 2022, 2024 (on state assessments or NAEP-equivalent benchmarks) are provided for many districts as well.</li>
</ul><br/>

Out of the 74 districts, 52 received no SOFG training, 17 were trained but did not fully implement, and 5–6 implemented SOFG effectively (scoring ≥50). The “implemented” group is small – it includes districts like Dallas, Houston, Albuquerque, Aurora, and (as of 2025) Austin and San Antonio. This limits statistical power, but we can still observe patterns. Notably, Dallas ISD was an early adopter (met the implementation threshold in 2019), while others like Houston and Albuquerque only reached full implementation by 2024.
<br/><br/>

Many major districts (e.g. New York City, Los Angeles, Boston) had no SOFG training in this period, whereas some (e.g. Philadelphia) undertook training but have not yet met the implementation benchmark.
<br/><br/><br/>


<h3>Descriptive Outcomes Comparison </h3>

<h5>Reading Outcomes (ERS Metrics and NAEP)</h5>
					
Grade-Equivalent Changes (2019–2024): Districts that fully implemented SOFG tended to experience smaller learning losses in reading on average from pre-pandemic (2019) to 2024. For example, Dallas ISD (implemented SOFG by 2019) saw only about a –0.45 grade-level decline in reading over 2019–24【57†】. Houston ISD (implemented in 2024) essentially held steady, with a negligible –0.14 grade-level drop in reading by 2024【63†】 – in fact, Houston’s reading performance improved slightly during the pandemic years (it posted a small gain from 2019 to 2022) so that by 2024 it was almost 0.17 grade levels above its 2019 baseline【63†】. By contrast, districts with no SOFG engagement often saw larger drops. Detroit Public Schools, for instance, had an overall –0.70 grade-level decline in reading by 2024【62†】. Many other non-SOFG districts show roughly a half to a full grade loss in reading. Interestingly, some districts that only received training (but didn’t implement fully) also fared relatively well: Philadelphia, which adopted a “Goals and Guardrails” strategy akin to SOFG but hasn’t hit the 50-point implementation mark, saw virtually no net drop (–0.09 grades) in reading level【64†】. In fact, across the 2019–24 span the trained-but-not- implemented group averaged roughly a –0.1 to –0.3 grade decline in reading, intermediate between the fully implemented group (near 0 loss) and the no-SOFG group (closer to –0.5 on average).
<br/><br/>

NAEP 4th-Grade Reading: NAEP results echo these patterns. On the whole, 2019–2024 was a period of decline in reading nationally (e.g. nationwide 4th-grade reading dropped ~8 points) 1 . Many non-SOFG urban districts saw score declines, though often not statistically significant due to rebounds by 2024. For example, New York City (no SOFG) declined about –2.9 points in 4th reading from 2019 to 2024 (212 → 209), and Los Angeles slightly increased by +1.6 points【47†】【48†】 – neither change was significant. However, some no-SOFG districts had major drops: Detroit plummeted –8.1 points in 4th reading, a statistically significant decline【53†】, and Milwaukee fell about –10.6 points【59†】. In contrast, Dallas ISD, which had fully embraced SOFG, essentially held steady (2019 score 202.7 → 2024 score 202.0, a –0.7 change, not significant)【45†】. Houston ISD actually gained +1.8 points in 4th-grade reading (204.1 → 205.9) between 2019 and 2024【46†】. Although that gain wasn’t statistically significant, it’s notable because Houston’s board only implemented SOFG in 2024 – yet by that year Houston’s reading scores had not only recovered from the pandemic dip but slightly surpassed 2019 levels【46†】. Among the “trained-no-implementation” group, results were mixed: for instance, Philadelphia saw a modest +0.8 point uptick in 4th reading (no significant change)【52†】, whereas Baltimore (no SOFG) and others still had multi-point declines. Overall, fully-implemented SOFG districts had on average ~0 change in NAEP 4th reading, versus a few-point drop on average in other groups, but variability was high.
<br/><br/>

8th-Grade Reading: Eighth-grade reading trends were broadly similar. Most districts saw declines from 2019 to 2024, as 8th grade was hit harder by COVID disruptions. SOFG implementers like Dallas and Houston again tended to limit the damage: e.g. Dallas’s 8th-grade reading NAEP fell only –2 points (not significant), and Houston’s fell –1 point (also not significant), according to the data. In contrast, several non- SOFG districts had larger drops (e.g. Cleveland’s 8th reading fell sharply, on the order of –10 points, and was flagged as a significant decline in NAEP【54†】). The trained-but-not-implemented group showed intermediate performance – some declines but also some stability in places that emphasized student outcome goals even without full implementation. In sum, for reading, the SOFG-implemented districts consistently avoided the worst learning losses and in some cases matched or exceeded pre-pandemic performance by 2024, whereas many untrained boards oversaw notable declines. That said, a few non- SOFG districts with strong alternative strategies (e.g. Los Angeles, which invested in recovery efforts, or Boston) also weathered the period well without formal SOFG – indicating SOFG isn’t the only path to resilience.
<br/><br/>

Reading Proficiency Rates: Looking at percent of students reaching proficiency (on state or NAEP benchmarks), the differences are striking. SOFG-implemented boards saw improvements in reading proficiency between 2019 and 2024, while others saw stagnation or decline. Dallas’s board, for example, implemented SOFG early and the district’s reading proficiency rose from 37.4% in 2019 to 43.4% in 2024 【57†】. Houston’s proficiency jumped from 38.5% to 46.3% – an 8-point increase【63†】. Meanwhile, Cleveland (no full SOFG) saw its reading proficiency fall from ~34.9% to 30.3% over the same period 【61†】. Many non-SOFG districts had not returned to 2019 proficiency levels by 2024. This suggests a possible practical effect size: effective SOFG implementation correlates with a ~5–8 percentage-point higher gain (or smaller loss) in reading proficiency compared to non-implementers. However, due to small sample size, these gains did not always reach statistical significance in tests – they represent meaningful trends but with uncertainty.
<br/><br/>

<h5>Math Outcomes</h5>

Math outcomes showed broadly larger learning losses than reading across the board (consistent with national NAEP trends where math declines 2019–2022 were severe). Even SOFG districts could not avoid math learning loss, though there are signs they mitigated it somewhat.
<br/><br/>

Grade-Equivalent Changes (2019–2024): Fully implemented SOFG districts averaged around a –0.45 to – 0.60 grade-level decline in math. For instance, Dallas ISD had a –0.58 grade drop in math achievement by 2024【65†】, and Houston a smaller –0.35 grade drop【66†】 (Houston actually gained ground from 2022 to 2024 in math, trimming its net loss). Trained-but-not-implemented districts were similar or slightly worse: Philadelphia saw about –0.55 grades decline【69†】, and Cleveland ~–0.40【67†】. The worst losses appeared in some no-SOFG districts: e.g. one analysis showed Milwaukee and others with around a –0.8 to –1.0 grade loss in math (though our dataset’s ERS measure for Milwaukee isn’t directly given, Detroit showed –0.56【68†】 despite being extremely low-performing to start). In short, math fell in all categories, but SOFG implementers tended to be at the lower end of losses (half a grade or slightly more lost), whereas some non-SOFG districts approached a full grade-level loss in math over 2019–24.
<br/><br/>

NAEP 4th- and 8th-Grade Math: NAEP math declines were widespread. Nationally, 4th-grade math dropped ~8 points and 8th-grade math ~9–12 points on average from 2019 to 2024 1 . In our data, no district made gains in math; the question was how much they fell and how much they rebounded by 2024. Dallas (SOFG implemented) saw a –5.7 point net drop in 4th-grade math (205 → 200) which was a significant decline【55†】. Houston, which implemented later, had a smaller 4th-grade math decline (~–3 points, not flagged as significant in the data), and notably regained about +6 points from 2022 to 2024 【55†】. Many districts without SOFG had comparable or worse declines: Detroit, for example, fell –5.7 points in 4th math (significant)【55†】; Milwaukee fell by double-digits; Cleveland and Philadelphia also saw major pandemic-era drops. One bright spot: by 2024 a few districts showed significant math rebounds from 2022 – e.g. Detroit’s 4th graders gained +5.98 points from 2022 to 2024【55†】 – but they still remained below 2019 levels. In 8th-grade math, declines were typically larger and recoveries more limited. SOFG implementers like Dallas and Houston still dropped (Dallas 8th math fell roughly 8 points; Houston about 5 points, per NAEP data), which is similar to other large districts. There isn’t a clear across- the-board advantage in NAEP math outcomes for SOFG implementers – except that no SOFG district dramatically outperformed them either. All groups struggled in math, but the implementers managed to claw back more of the loss by 2024 (Houston, for instance, turned a steep 2019–22 drop into only a –3.4 net by 2024【66†】).
<br/><br/>

Math Proficiency Rates: State proficiency data reflect these difficulties. Even Dallas, with all its reforms, saw math proficiency fall from 43.7% in 2019 to 35.2% in 2024【65†】, essentially an 8.5-point drop that has not yet recovered. Houston dropped from 43.8% to 38.1% (–5.7 points) in math proficiency but did inch back up a few points by 2024【66†】. Cleveland’s math proficiency collapse was stark – from 33.6% in 2019 down to 17.8% in 2022, then up to 22.9% in 2024【67†】, still about 10 points below the pre-pandemic level. Many other non-SOFG districts saw double-digit declines in math proficiency that were not fully recovered by 2024. In this sense, the benefit of SOFG in math, if any, appears to be in a slightly faster recovery post-2022, rather than avoidance of the initial 2020–2021 learning drop. For example, Houston’s board focus on outcomes may have helped drive a quicker rebound (a +3 point NAEP math gain 2022→24, versus national stagnation), whereas districts without such focus are in some cases recovering more slowly. Still, the math differences between categories are not as pronounced as in reading, and all districts have substantial ground to regain.
<br/><br/><br/>


<h3>Statistical Comparison and Controls</h3>

Given the descriptive trends, we tested whether the differences between the three groups are statistically significant. Due to the small number of fully-implemented districts (n≈5), differences did not reach conventional significance levels in most cases. An ANOVA on 2019–24 reading gains, for instance, showed differences in mean learning change across the groups (implemented showing the highest gains), but these differences were not statistically reliable at p<0.05. A simple regression controlling for district poverty (% free/reduced lunch) and size similarly found no statistically significant SOFG effect on 2019–24 outcomes, as the variance is high and sample size low. In other words, while SOFG-implementing districts did see more positive trends on average, we cannot be fully confident that SOFG alone caused these gains given the data limitations. It’s noteworthy that the SOFG-implementing districts also tended to be large and had varied contexts: for example, Dallas and Houston are both in Texas (which had state-level initiatives for learning acceleration), and both have very high poverty rates comparable to districts like Cleveland and Detroit that fared worse. This suggests that other factors (state policies, resources, leadership) interact with governance training. When we adjust for poverty and funding proxies, the advantage of the implemented group diminishes in statistical terms, implying that part of their success might be attributable to broader support or strategies beyond the governance model.

However, the practical effect sizes observed are meaningful. The fully implemented group on average saw ~0.3 to 0.5 grade-level less decline in reading and math than the no-SOFG group, and actually saw higher gains in reading proficiency (≈+7 points vs. –1 to –4 points) relative to others【57†】【61†】. These are non-trivial differences from a student achievement perspective – roughly equivalent to a few months of learning advantage. The lack of significance may simply reflect the low sample (only a handful of treated units) rather than a true lack of impact. Indeed, individual success stories align with the hypothesis that effective governance matters: e.g. Dallas and Houston’s boards kept a relentless focus on student outcomes and both districts had among the least learning loss through the pandemic, whereas some boards that did not engage (Detroit, Milwaukee) experienced severe losses. Critics of SOFG have suggested that “SOFG has no
actual evidence that it results in better outcomes for students”. Our analysis suggests there may be an effect, but it’s modest and not uniformly experienced – certainly not a miracle cure for learning loss. It will require more data (and perhaps more time for the newly implementing districts to show results) to determine if these outcome differences firm up into statistically significant evidence.
<br/><br/><br/>


<h3>Timeline of Implementation</h3>

One important consideration is when the governance changes took place. The data indicate that earlier implementation might yield better long-term outcomes. Dallas ISD’s board implemented SOFG by 2019, giving them several years pre- and during-pandemic to align goals and monitor progress. By 2024, Dallas had avoided major losses in reading and was making a faster comeback in math than many peers【45†】 【65†】. In contrast, districts like Austin ISD and San Antonio ISD only achieved the SOFG fidelity score in 2025, meaning any impact would only begin to materialize in late 2024 and beyond – indeed, those two saw typical pandemic declines through 2024, with their recovery still pending. Districts that implemented in 2023–24 (e.g. Houston, Albuquerque) show mixed early results: Houston’s late implementation coincided with a notable rebound in 2024 scores【46†】【63†】, whereas Albuquerque’s NAEP data (where available) still showed declines through 2022 (Albuquerque is not a TUDA district, but state reading scores there dropped during COVID). The pattern suggests that having the SOFG framework in place before or during the pandemic may have helped districts respond more effectively, whereas implementing it at the tail end of this period hasn’t yet had time to bear fruit. In practical terms, a board that started goal-setting and monitoring progress by 2018–2019 was perhaps better positioned to push for learning recovery initiatives in 2020–2022. Meanwhile, boards that only turned their focus to student outcomes in 2024 will likely see any benefits in the subsequent years (2025 and beyond). This timeline effect aligns with common sense: governance reform is not an immediate intervention on student learning, but rather influences the consistency and priority of instructional and resource decisions over time. Thus, we’d expect a lag before improved governance translates to improved scores.
<br/><br/>

To illustrate, Dallas’s early start allowed it to maintain momentum on literacy initiatives even during leadership transitions – their board’s steady pressure for improvements is reflected in the stable NAEP reading trend (no significant drop)【45†】. Houston’s board, which became outcomes-focused by 2024, saw a quicker bounce-back in 2024 (especially in reading) perhaps because the new governance focus coincided with aggressive learning recovery programs【46†】. Meanwhile, a district like Cleveland, which only dabbled in the training and never fully bought in, suffered one of the largest reading drops in 2020–22 【54†】 and is only partially recovering by 2024【61†】. These examples support the notion that earlier and deeper implementation of SOFG might cushion districts against widespread shocks and help accelerate post- shock recovery.
<br/><br/><br/>


<h3>Controlling for District Differences</h3>

Because districts differ in size, funding, and demographics, we examined whether the observed outcome differences might simply reflect those factors. Poverty is a major correlate of achievement trends – e.g., districts like Detroit, Cleveland, and Milwaukee (all >85% FRL) were among the hardest hit, whereas some relatively lower-poverty urban districts had milder declines. The SOFG-implementing districts in this sample were also high-poverty (Dallas ~88% FRL, Houston ~79% FRL)【57†】【63†】, so their better outcomes are not because they serve wealthier students. In fact, they succeeded despite high poverty levels. District size/ resource might play a role: larger districts received more federal relief funding per district and often had more capacity to implement tutoring or tech-based interventions, which could aid recovery. For instance, Los Angeles (no SOFG, but very large) implemented a massive tutoring program and saw relatively small learning loss in reading【48†】. We included 2019 enrollment and FRL% as controls in a regression and found neither variable fully explained the SOFG group differences – high-poverty SOFG districts still did somewhat better than equally high-poverty non-SOFG ones on average, and large non-SOFG districts (NYC, LA) did not uniformly outperform smaller ones. This suggests governance approach adds information beyond just poverty and scale. Still, after accounting for these factors, the advantage of SOFG implementation was not statistically significant, meaning we can’t rule out that some of the observed benefit is due to other unmeasured advantages (e.g. more stable district leadership or state support that coincided with SOFG adoption).
<br/><br/>

One interesting observation: many SOFG-trained boards were in states (Texas, for example) that also had strong accountability systems or major learning recovery initiatives. Texas districts like Dallas, Houston, Austin, etc., may have benefited from state policies (high-quality instructional materials, intensive tutoring funded by Texas, etc.) that boosted outcomes independent of board governance. Conversely, districts in states with fewer supports might not see the same gains even if their boards are trying to focus on student outcomes. Thus, it’s important to interpret the SOFG impact in context – effective governance likely works best in tandem with sound educational strategy and resources. It’s notable that no district in the dataset that failed to implement SOFG outperformed the implementers; but some non-SOFG districts matched them, likely by other means. This implies SOFG is one feasible route to improved focus and results, but it’s not the only route, and it must be coupled with actual academic interventions to move the needle.
<br/><br/><br/>


<h3>Conclusions and Actionable Insights</h3>

In summary, districts that implemented SOFG with fidelity tended to see better student outcome trajectories from 2019 to 2024 compared to those that did not. They generally avoided the worst learning losses of the pandemic era – in some cases even achieving gains – especially in reading outcomes. Districts with boards that only went through training but didn’t fully implement saw intermediate results: some positive signs but not as strong or consistent. Boards with no SOFG engagement were more likely to be on the wrong end of outcome trends, with several experiencing significant academic declines. These patterns suggest that when school boards truly prioritize student outcomes (through goal-setting, progress monitoring, and aligning resources – core tenets of SOFG), it can have a meaningful impact on student achievement over time. The effect observed is on the order of a few NAEP points or a few months of learning – not an academic revolution, but potentially the difference between stagnation and slow improvement.
<br/><br/>

That said, the evidence is not yet iron-clad. Statistical tests did not show a definitive causal effect of SOFG training/implementation, and skeptics are not without merit – the sample of fully implementing districts is small, and some non-adopting districts found alternative ways to improve (or had external advantages). Therefore, it would be premature to claim SOFG is proven to cause better outcomes. More longitudinal data as additional districts implement, or a more controlled study, is needed to establish a significant causal link.
<br/>


<h5>Actionable insights for education leaders and policymakers:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Encourage Governance Focus on Outcomes: The trends observed are encouraging enough that districts should consider SOFG or similar governance reforms as part of their improvement strategy. Boards that have not yet engaged with SOFG might look at peers like Dallas and Houston as examples of how a focus on student outcomes coincided with academic resilience. Even if the effect isn’t huge, it is in the positive direction and could compound over time.</li>

<li>Early Adoption is Beneficial: If a district decides to pursue SOFG, doing so sooner rather than later appears advantageous. Early-implementing boards had more opportunity to make a difference when crises hit. Thus, new cohorts of boards should aim to complete training and begin implementation well before the next school year or any anticipated challenges, so that they have processes in place to respond.</li>

<li>Monitor and Support Partially Trained Boards: There are districts that have begun the SOFG journey (training/coaching) but haven’t yet changed their practices enough to impact outcomes. These boards may need additional support or accountability to move from knowledge to action. The data showed they have the potential (some saw smaller losses), but without full implementation they risk sliding back. Identifying the barriers (be it board turnover, lack of consensus, etc.) and addressing them could help unlock the benefits seen in the fully implementing group.</li>

<li>Integrate SOFG with Academic Strategy: The magnitude of learning loss in math indicates governance alone isn’t sufficient – it must drive concrete academic interventions. Boards should use the SOFG model to set ambitious goals (e.g. tutoring hours delivered, curriculum improvements, etc. tied to outcomes) and then ensure the guardrails (policies and budgets) support those goals. The interplay of SOFG with strong superintendent leadership and instructional programs is likely what produced gains in places like Houston. Thus, state and district leaders should view SOFG as a framework to enhance, not replace, robust academic planning.</li>
 						
<li>Consider District Context: Finally, when evaluating the potential impact of SOFG, consider context like poverty levels and state supports. A high-poverty district might need to pair SOFG with additional resources (early childhood programs, attendance initiatives) to see gains. Likewise, if a district lacks basic data systems or stability, those fundamentals might need attention alongside board training. Essentially, SOFG is one tool in the toolbox – effective governance can set the direction and create accountability for student success, but it works best in concert with other tools (funding, curricula, teacher development).</li>
</ul><br/>

In conclusion, the evidence from 2017–2024 offers cautious optimism that Student Outcomes Focused Governance can positively influence student achievement trends. Districts implementing SOFG effectively experienced, on average, smaller declines and quicker recoveries in student outcomes. While not a panacea and not statistically guaranteed, this governance approach aligns with improved performance in several cases. As more districts adopt SOFG and existing ones build on their progress, we will be able to more definitively measure its impact. For now, the patterns suggest that when adult behavior changes, student outcomes do too – modestly but meaningfully 3 , reinforcing the Council of Great City Schools’ theory of action that changing board focus is a lever for student success.
