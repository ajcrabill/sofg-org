        <h5>Using the Framework</h5>
        This instrument is best used by the full governing team -- the school board and superintendent -- with guidance from a coach specifically certified in its application. After receiving an orientation to the framework, each individual school board member and the superintendent should give the school board a score for each practice area. When the score for each practice area is added together, this will reveal an overall score between 0 and 100, where a 0 indicates that the school board is ineffectively focusing on its goals for improving student outcomes and a 100 which indicates that the school board is highly effective at focusing on its goals for improving student outcomes. After each member of the governing team have scored the school board individually, then the coach will lead the governing team collectively through a process of scoring the school board for the first time. This will create the school board’s starting point data which, in addition to providing a measurable score, provides the school board with clarity about its strengths and weaknesses relative to being an effective school board. 
        <br/><br/>
        Once a starting point has been set, the school board should schedule time during a public meeting every three months to go through this process again as a means of self evaluating over time. Ideally each quarter the school board’s focus on improving student outcomes meaningfully increases. When using the instrument to conduct an evaluation, most indicators should be evaluated for the previous three month period unless indicated otherwise. Indicators that are about training and listening should generally be evaluated for the previous thirty-six month period unless indicated otherwise.
        <br/><br/>
        It is typical to go from a score of 0 to a score of 80+ over the course of two years, but only with the aid of a coach certified in this work. School boards that attempt this work without the support of a coach almost always fail; the adult behavior changes required are simply too great.

                    The Board has adopted only SMART goals that include a specific measure, population, starting point, an ending point, a starting date, and an ending date.
                                            
                    The Board has adopted no fewer than one and no more than five goals. Fewer goals allow for greater focus; more allow for less.
                    
                    The Superintendent has adopted, in collaboration with the Board, one to three interim goals to progress monitor each goal, and each interim goal is SMART.
                    
                    The status of each interim goal is able to be updated multiple times during each school year.
                    
                    The Board publicly posted the goals for public comment prior to adoption.

                    The Board’s goals all pertain to desired student outcomes. 

                    In addition to the goal ending points, the Board has adopted annual targets, goal ending points for each year leading up to the ending dates. The Superintendent has provided interim goal ending points for each year leading up to the ending date.
                    
                    All interim goals pertain to student outputs or student outcomes, not inputs or adult outputs.
                    
                    The Board included students, parents, staff, and community members in the goal development process.
                    
                    All Board goals last from three to five years; all interim goals last from one to three years.
                    
                    The goals and interim goals will challenge the organization and will require change in adult behaviors.

                    The Board used a process that included students, parents, staff, and community members in a way that leads them to express ownership of the adopted goals.

                    All of the interim goals are predictive of their respective goals, and are influenceable by the Superintendent (and the Superintendent’s team). Predictive suggests that there is some evidence of a correlation between the interim goal and the goal. Influenceable suggests that the Superintendent -- and through them, the staff -- has authority over roughly 80% of the inputs the interim goal is measuring.
                    
                    The Board relied on a root cause analysis, comprehensive student needs assessment, and/or similar research-based tool to inform identification of and prioritization of potential goals.

Each guardrail describes a single operational action or class of actions the Superintendent may not use or allow in pursuit of the goals.

                    The Board has adopted no fewer than one and no more than five guardrails. Fewer guardrails allow for more focus; more allow for less.

                    The Board has considered adoption of one or more theories of action to drive the school system’s overall strategic direction. If there is a permanent Superintendent, that person was included in the theory consideration process.

                    The majority of the Board’s monitoring sessions during the period were rated Effective or Highly Effective.

                     - Leadership Evaluation: Board self eval, Board time use eval, and Superintendent eval
                     - Voting: debating and voting on any item (these activities are never a form of goal/guardrail monitoring)

Existing policies that do not meet one of these criteria have been removed from the Board’s policy manual (though the Superintendent may retain them as administrative policy/regulation).
                    
                    The Board made no edits to the Board's regularly scheduled meeting agenda during the meeting and during the three business days before the meeting unless a state of emergency was declared.
